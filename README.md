# About Empiria Steps

[Empiria Steps](http://www.ontica.org/) is our project and workflow management integrated suite for
governments and enterprises.

This repository corresponds to the system's backend.

As other Empiria products, this backend runs over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions).

This solution is based on C# 7.0 and .NET Framework 4.7 and projects can be compiled using
Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
