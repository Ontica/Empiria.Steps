# About Empiria Steps

[Empiria Steps](http://www.ontica.org/) is our project and workflow management solution for governments and enterprises.

This repository corresponds to the system's backend.

This solution is based on C# 6.0 and .NET Framework 4.6 and the web API is tailored on ASP .NET Web API 2.2.

As other Empiria products, this backend runs over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions).

The project can be compiled using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
