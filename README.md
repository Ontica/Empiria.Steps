# About Empiria Steps

[Empiria Steps](http://www.ontica.org/) is our project and process management integrated suite for
governments and other sectors and industries.

This repository corresponds to the system's backend.

As other Empiria products, this backend runs over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions).

This solution is based on C# 8.0 and .NET Framework 4.8 and projects can be compiled using
Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.
